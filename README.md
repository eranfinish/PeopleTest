# PeopleTest Project

## Overview
The **PeopleTest Project** is a web application designed to manage a database of people. It features an Angular front-end, a .NET 6 API backend, and a SQL Server database. The project showcases CRUD operations, two-way data binding, and integration with Material Design components.

## Features

### Frontend (Angular)
- **Two-way data binding**: Implemented using Angular's FormsModule and Material Design components.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Angular Material components for a modern look.
- **CRUD Operations**: 
  - Add, edit, view, and delete people records.
  - Gender selection using a dropdown menu (e.g., Male/Female).
- **Validation**: Form fields include validation to ensure data integrity.

### Backend (ASP.NET Core 6 API)
- **Endpoints**: RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core.
  - Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) endpoints for managing people.
- **Database Integration**: Uses Entity Framework Core for database management.
- **Migrations**: Database schema changes are managed using EF Core migrations.

### Database (SQL Server)
- **Schema**: Contains tables to store person details.
- **Stored Procedures**: Includes SQL procedures for optimized data access.
